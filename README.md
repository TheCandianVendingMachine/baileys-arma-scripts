# Bailey's Cool Scripts

**See the individual script folders for instructions on how to use.**

The `init.sqf` call is required for all scripts to work. Some scripts require `description.ext`.
If your game crashes after you delete scripts you don't want, you probably have references to it
in the `description.ext`

## How to use

Copy the folder structure as it appears in this file. Copy the lines from `init.sqf` and
`description.ext`. Copy and paste the `tcvm` folder as it appears here. Delete scripts
you aren't wanting to use.
